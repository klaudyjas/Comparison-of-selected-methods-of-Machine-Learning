# Comparison-of-selected-methods-of-Machine-Learning
Program used: RSES.
Confusion matrices were generated using selected machine learning methods and compared with each other. 
The data set was divided into training and testing parts, and they were also tested six times. 
The following methods were used for testing: 
- Rule classifiers (exhaustive algorithm, genetic algorithm, covering algorithm), 
- LTF-C neural classifier (neural networks), 
- Cross-validation method.
